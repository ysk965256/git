"git "
frist lanch server then after install git
make a directory and go to that directory
git init .=initialize the git,
add some file into that directory,that files are in working area,here git has 3 life cycles (1 is working areaa,2 is staging or index area,3 is local repo),
_to storing our code into git local repo use this comands,
-basically our code by default will be in work area,      -git status---command,
-git add "filename" pushing our code into staging area,   --git ls-files ---command to see staging area filles
-git comit -m "comment t" pushing our code into local repo, --git log 0r git log --oneline or git log --oneline --graph or git log --reflog -- commands for detail info of local area,



-git branching topic------
git checkout master  ---switching into master branch,
git checkout -b siva  --creating and switching int0 branch mode command
git checkout branch
git branch ---to see how many banches and pointer is pointing which branch command,


--git reset---
git mixed commit id -- thiscommand is used to delete staging area and local repo file 
git soft commit id --this command delete local repo specific fille
git hard cmmit id  --this command will delete all areas followed by commit id




--git tag --
git tag v.1.0 commit id  ---this comman gives the proper info and adding tags to that specfic commit
git tag -a v.1.2.0 commit id --this command gives annonated tag to that specfic commit,

---git merge concept--


git merge --command this merge the modifications what andall done in branches that al modifications reflectes into master branch 
git mergetool --this command shows graph of files
git cherrt-pick commit id  --comand mainly used for it reducess merge conflict and merging certain commits only,

branch to master is fastforward merge,




---git push --


frist create a new repo in remote repo,
copy that repo link

and give the command into the server means our local repo area


git remote add origin "link"
git push origin master or branch is our choice which one we want to push or we can followed by commit id we can push our code into remote repo
give credintials : git id  
git pass:our git passwrd is not working we need generate token and use that token as a passwrd or passwrd less authentication we can do,
   cd ~/.ssh
   ls -ltr
   goto pub key and copy that key  paste into remote repo ssh key option and paste into it ,


--git clone ,git pull git fetch--


git clone url ---we clone the entire repo into our local repo by using command from remote repo,


dev2 what all changes he had done into code  we can check by using  fetch command

-git fetch origin,
-git pull origin  --this command will helps to see all changes and alternativley merging opertion will also done using this command
